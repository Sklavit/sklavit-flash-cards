# Flashcard Spaced Repetition PWA - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for learning with textual flashcards using an efficient spaced repetition algorithm (SM-2). The app allows users to create and manage decks of cards, track learning progress, and study with optimal scheduling. Fully offline-capable with optional LLM-powered card generation.

## Planning Directory

The `/planning` directory contains structured documentation for development and decision-making:

### Using Planning Documents During Development

**Before Starting Work:**
1. Check `/planning/in-progress.md` for current sprint tasks
2. Read the user story in `/planning/requests/{feature}.md` (understand what users want)
3. Review the specification in `/planning/specs/{feature}.md` (understand implementation structure)
4. Follow the technical tasks in `/planning/todo/{feature}.md` (detailed implementation steps)
5. Read design decisions in `/planning/design_decisions/` to understand architecture

**When Adding Features:**
1. Read the user story in `/planning/requests/{feature}.md` - WHAT users want
2. Check `/planning/specs/{feature}.md` - HOW the system should be structured
   - Review file structure, functions, data model, component interactions
   - Check implementation notes and considerations
3. Follow the technical tasks in `/planning/todo/{feature}.md` - DETAILED STEPS
4. Implement in code matching the spec exactly
5. Update `/planning/specs/{feature}.md` with actual implementation if it differs
6. Reference planning docs in code comments (line numbers or section names)
7. When complete, create documentation in `/planning/done/{feature}.md`

**When Making Architectural Decisions:**
1. Review `/planning/design_decisions/` for previous rationales
2. Document new decisions if they differ from planning docs
3. Update relevant planning docs if approach changes

**When Encountering Limitations:**
1. Check `/planning/future/` for planned enhancements
2. Evaluate if immediate solution or defer to MVP+
3. Document constraints encountered for future reference

**When Optimizing or Scaling:**
1. Reference `/planning/future/performance_optimizations.md`
2. Follow suggested priority order for improvements
3. Add performance metrics to track improvements

## Current Architecture

### Core Approach

**Offline-First Spaced Repetition Learning**
- Client-side only: All computation and storage on device
- localStorage-based persistence for cards, progress, and decks
- SM-2 algorithm for optimal scheduling
- PWA for offline capability and home-screen installation
- Optional LLM integration for card generation (user's own API key)
- No backend required - fully self-contained

- Color-coded quality buttons (red to green gradient)

## Workflow

### Review Session (Study Cards)

1. User opens app and selects deck
2. App loads cards and progress from localStorage
3. User taps "Study Now" or "Review Due Cards"
4. App finds cards scheduled for today
5. App displays card front (question)
6. User reads and recalls answer
7. User taps to reveal back (answer)
8. User rates retention (0-5 quality scale)
9. App applies SM-2 algorithm:
   - Calculates new interval
   - Updates ease factor
   - Sets next review date
10. App shows next due card
11. Repeat from step 5

### Creating/Editing Cards

1. User clicks "New Card" or "Edit Card"
2. Modal opens with question and answer fields
3. User enters card content
4. User optionally sets tags or difficulty
5. User saves card
6. App generates unique ID
7. App saves to localStorage
8. Card added to current deck

### Switching Decks

1. User clicks deck selector dropdown
2. List shows all available decks
3. User selects different deck
4. App loads deck's cards and progress
5. Card count and stats update
6. User can now study selected deck

### Generating Cards with LLM (Optional, Online)

1. User clicks "Generate Cards"
2. Modal prompts for topic or text
3. User provides input
4. App sends request to LLM service (user's API key)
5. LLM generates card pairs (Q&A)
6. App displays preview of generated cards
7. User can edit before saving
8. User confirms to add to deck
9. Cards saved to localStorage

### Exporting Data

1. User clicks "Export"
2. Browser downloads JSON file with all data
3. File contains: cards, progress, decks, timestamps
4. User can backup or analyze data
5. File can be imported later

### Time Travel (Manual Review on Past Date)

1. User opens date picker
2. User selects past date
3. App filters cards due on that date
4. User reviews cards as if in past
5. App tracks review with past timestamp
6. Progress updates relative to selected date
7. Useful for catching up or adjusting progress

## Technical Considerations

### Data Persistence
- Uses localStorage (5-10MB limit) for MVP
- Stores: cards, progress, decks, settings (all as JSON)
- Data persists across browser sessions and app updates
- Future: Migrate to IndexedDB for datasets > 1000 cards
- Serialization happens only on save (efficient)

### SM-2 Algorithm Accuracy
- Interval calculations use integer days
- Timestamps precise to milliseconds
- Quality ratings: 0-5 scale (integer)
- Ease factor: Floating-point (1.3-2.5 range)
- All calculations deterministic (no randomness in scheduling)
- Random selection only when multiple cards due

### Browser Compatibility
- Requires ES6+ support (modern browsers)
- localStorage API (all modern browsers)
- Service Worker (all modern browsers)
- CSS Grid (modern browsers)
- Date/time APIs (all browsers)
- Works on desktop and mobile

### PWA Features
- Service worker enables offline functionality
- All assets cached on first load
- Can be installed to home screen (macOS, iOS, Android)
- Works completely without network (after initial load)
- App icon and metadata via manifest.json
- Optional: Update cache in background when online

### Storage Scaling
- 100 cards: ~50KB (minimal impact)
- 1000 cards: ~500KB (good performance)
- 10000 cards: ~5MB (approaching limit, consider IndexedDB)
- Review history adds ~100 bytes per review
- Plan data cleanup strategy for large datasets

## Development Notes

### Working with Planning Documents

**Planning Directory Organization:**
- `/planning/requests/` = User stories (what users want)
- `/planning/todo/` = Technical tasks (how to implement)
- `/planning/done/` = Completed features (implementation docs)
- `/planning/in-progress.md` = Current sprint priorities
- Files are cross-linked (each requests/*.md links to todo/*.md and vice versa)

**Before Implementing a Feature:**
1. Check `/planning/in-progress.md` for current priorities
2. Read the user story in `/planning/requests/{feature}.md` (understand what users want)
3. Read the technical task in `/planning/todo/{feature}.md` (understand how to build it)
4. Review data structures, function signatures, and testing requirements
5. Note cross-references to related features
6. Reference planning docs in your code comments

**When Implementing Core Logic:**
1. Check `/planning/design_decisions/` for architecture choices
2. Consult the spec file for file structure and function signatures
3. SM-2 algorithm example:
   - User story: `/planning/requests/spaced_repetition.md`
   - Spec: `/planning/specs/spaced_repetition.md` (implementation structure and formulas)
   - Tasks: `/planning/todo/spaced_repetition.md` (detailed step-by-step)
4. Follow the technical tasks in order, matching the spec exactly
5. Keep code organized according to the spec file structure
6. Reference the spec in code comments: "See /planning/specs/cards.md:45"

**After Implementing a Feature:**
1. Update `/planning/specs/{feature}.md` to reflect actual implementation
2. Note any deviations from the planned spec and why
3. Add actual line numbers if significantly different
4. Document key decisions made during implementation

**When Fixing Bugs:**
1. Determine if bug is in logic or data
2. Verify against user story in `/planning/requests/{feature}.md`
3. Verify against technical task in `/planning/todo/{feature}.md`
4. Update planning docs if spec was incomplete
5. Test fix thoroughly

**When Completing a Feature:**
1. Complete the feature according to `/planning/requests/` (user story) and `/planning/todo/` (technical task) specifications
2. Test thoroughly with all use cases
3. Create implementation documentation in `/planning/done/{feature}.md` describing what was implemented
4. Update `/planning/in-progress.md` to mark feature as complete
5. Note any deviations from original spec and why

**When Starting New Development:**
1. Move feature from `/planning/requests/` into `/planning/in-progress.md`
2. Follow technical tasks from `/planning/todo/{feature}.md`
3. Update acceptance criteria checklist as you progress
4. Cross-reference related features in comments

### Common Development Tasks

**Understanding the Specification Workflow:**
The three-document approach for each feature:
1. **requests/** = "What does the user need?" (user stories, acceptance criteria)
2. **specs/** = "How should we structure this?" (file layout, functions, data models)
3. **todo/** = "What are the detailed steps?" (task-by-task implementation)
4. **done/** = "What did we build?" (documentation after completion)

Example: Implementing cards feature
```
Start: Read /planning/requests/cards.md (user stories)
  ↓
Check: /planning/specs/cards.md (understand file structure, functions)
  ↓
Follow: /planning/todo/cards.md (implementation tasks)
  ↓
Code: Write script.js following spec structure
  ↓
Update: /planning/specs/cards.md (reflect actual implementation)
  ↓
Document: /planning/done/cards.md (explain what was built)
```

**Adding a Card Property:**
1. Check `/planning/specs/cards.md` for current data model structure
2. Update card structure in spec and code
3. Update storage serialization if needed
4. Update export/import functions
5. Update `/planning/specs/cards.md` to reflect the change
6. Test persistence across page reload

**Modifying SM-2 Algorithm:**
1. Review user story in `/planning/requests/spaced_repetition.md`
2. Review technical task in `/planning/todo/spaced_repetition.md`
3. Document change in code comments with reference to planning
4. Test with various quality ratings (0-5)
5. Verify ease factor stays in 1.3-2.5 range
6. Check interval calculations

**Creating a New Deck:**
1. Reference user story in `/planning/requests/decks.md`
2. Follow tasks in `/planning/todo/decks.md`
3. Generate unique ID
4. Save to localStorage
5. Update UI deck selector
6. Verify against acceptance criteria

**Exporting/Importing Data:**
1. Reference `/planning/requests/cards.md` for user expectations
2. Follow format specs in `/planning/todo/cards.md`
3. Include timestamps for reproducibility
4. Handle missing/extra fields gracefully
5. Test round-trip (export then import)

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create new deck

- [ ] Review cards (various quality ratings)
- [ ] Switch between decks
- [ ] Check progress persistence
- [ ] Refresh page (data still there?)
- [ ] Export data to file
- [ ] Import exported file
- [ ] Delete card (confirm progress deleted)
- [ ] Offline mode works
- [ ] UI responsive on mobile

## Code Quality Notes

**MVP Strengths:**
- Simple, readable code
- Single-page app (no routing complexity)
- No external dependencies (pure vanilla JS)
- Lightweight and fast
- Completely offline-capable
- Deterministic algorithm (SM-2)

**MVP Limitations (by design for simplicity):**
- Minimal input validation (assume valid user input)
- Basic error handling for storage
- Simple UI (no complex interactions)
- Limited accessibility features (can add later)
- No unit tests (can add in phase 2+)

**Code Organization:**
- Global state at top of `script.js`
- Core functions: SM-2 algorithm, card operations, storage
- UI functions: Display updates, user interaction
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments only where logic isn't self-evident

**Avoiding Common Pitfalls:**
- Don't add features beyond requirements
- Don't over-engineer (YAGNI principle)
- Don't add validation for impossible scenarios
- Don't create abstractions for one-time code
- Keep it simple: Three similar lines beats premature abstraction

**When to Refactor:**
- Code is duplicated 3+ times
- Function is > 50 lines
- Complex nested logic is hard to follow
- Performance is measurably slow

**When to Keep It Simple:**
- MVP phase (ship features first)
- Experimental code (may delete soon)
- One-time utility functions
- Small isolated modules

## Contact & Maintenance
